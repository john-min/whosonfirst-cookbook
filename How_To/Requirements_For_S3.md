#What is Required for S3 Import Files?

While we can never account for all edge cases, we _can_ develop an import strategy for the majority of issues. _Things will break and we will fix them._ Here is a brief rundown of what is required of `.geojson` files placed in the `whosonfirst.mapzen.com` S3 misc folder:

##We must **always** have the following attributes:

* **id**: _(`wof:id`)_
* **placetype**: _(`wof:placetype`)_
* **name**: _(`wof:name`)_
* **country**: _(ideally: `iso:country` / otherwise: `wof:country`)_
* **parent id**: _(`wof:parent_id`)_

##We should **not** include the following:

* **Un-prefixed attribute headings** _(ex: `name`, `parent`, or `id`)_
* **Descendant ids** _(we donâ€™t need to include child ids)_

##For one-off parenting issues:

* **Do not include a valid `wof:parent_id` of one of the parent records.**
* **Instead, include one of the following values:**
  * **`-1`** _(unknown, needs review)_
  * **`-2`** _(shrug, really complicated)_
  * **`-3`** _(contested, but not disputed.. ex: multiple parent records)_
